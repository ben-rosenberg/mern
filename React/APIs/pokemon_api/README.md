# Pokemon API

Introductory assignment for fetching JSON data from APIs in React using the PokeAPI. The assignment only asked for a button that, when clicked, fetches the first 807 Pokemon in the API, but I decided to integrate two additional inputs, one for limiting the __number of results__, and the other for __offsetting the results__. If, for example, 25 is entered in both inputs, it will show Pokemon 26-50.
