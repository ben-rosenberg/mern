# Routing Practice

Introductory React routing assignment. Three routes are handled:

1. /home
    - A generic welcome message is displayed.
2. /:variable
    - An h2 tag with either "The number is {variable}" if the string from the route is numeric, or "The word is {variable}" otherwise.
3. /:variable/:textColor/:backgroundColor
    - The same as route #2 except the h2 element's text color is textColor and background color is backgroundColor, assuming valid colors are provided.
